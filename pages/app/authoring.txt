===== Mobilize Campaign Authoring Tool =====
The Mobilize Campaign Authoring Tool was developed as a graphical alternative to authoring a campaign in XML.  While it's important to note that this tool is still under development, it can be a great reference point for getting started authoring campaigns, and a great way to compare your authored XML to XML generated by the tool! Also, because of it's 'in-development' state, your screen may differ slightly from the screenshots. A detailed walkthrough of the app is below -- it covers the creation of a simple sample campaign about snacking! If you are unsure what any of the fields are for, be sure to click the question marks next to that field and also note that unless a field is marked as required, it is not necessary that supply/change any information!

==== Detailed Walkthrough ====
Visit https://lausd.mobilizingcs.org/authoring and log in to get started.  After logging in, you should be on the "Create Campaign" page. Before being able to define your surveys/questions, you'll need to fill in some data about your campaign.  

{{ :app:authoring:authoring02.png?direct&700 |}}

The required fields on this page are the Campaign Name, Campaign URN, Class, Privacy State and Running State.  You'll note that the Campaign URN is actually generated for you, and updates automatically as you fill in the other boxes. Students in ECS classes should take great care to read the tooltips and select names that will make their campaigns distinguishable from classmates' but also *do not* provide any student-identifiable information.  For example, name your campaign using: Topic PeriodNumber TeacherLastName Year Fall/Spring. For Classes, select the class you are creating this campaign for. Privacy State and Running State can both be left as default. See the screenshot with data filled in.

After clicking "Create Campaign" you will be taken to the "Create New Survey" page. Here you'll need to fill in some basic information about your first survey (Campaigns can hold many surveys, but for this sample we'll just use one survey). Survey ID, Title, and Submit Text are all required.  Survey ID must be unique in your campaign, Title should be something that will make your survey easy to distinguish and Submit Text is simply what users will see at the end of your survey (so you can use something like "Thanks for Participating!"). See the screen with the sample Snack data information.

After clicking "Create Survey" you'll now be able to define all of the questions in your surveys (known as prompts). 

{{ :app:authoring:authoring05.png?direct&700 |}}

Click on "Create new prompt" to do so.  Now you can fill in the required information for your first prompt.  In the screenshow below you'll see that we've entered a Prompt ID, a Display Label and Prompt Text.  

{{ :app:authoring:authoring07.png?direct&700 |}}

Now you'll need to select the type of prompt to use: you can use Single Choice (responders can select one choice from a list of options), Multiple Choice (responders can select multiple choices form a list of options), Number (users can select a number), Text (users can enter text), Photo (users can use their smartphone devices to take a picture) among others.  For the first question we'll select Single Choice, which opens a menu where you can enter your choices.  You only need to enter information under "label" here, using the + or x buttons to add and remove options as well as the up and down arrows to change the order of the options.

After clicking "Save Changes" you will be taken back and can finish creating your prompt.  If you'd like to make the prompt skippable, feel free to select that option (but note this may make it harder to analyze your data later).

After clicking "Add Prompt" it will shrink these options and let you create another prompt!

{{ :app:authoring:authoring10.png?direct&700 |}}

Let's add another prompt. This time we'll select text. The prompt type options for text are the lower and upper character limits. In the screenshot below the numbers entered are 1 and 256, providing space for a large amount of text.

{{ :app:authoring:authoring11.png?direct&700 |}}

And the completed text prompt:

{{ :app:authoring:authoring12.png?direct&700 |}}

Now we'll create a prompt using the number prompt type. For the number prompt type you can define the range of numbers responders can use -- the screenshot shows a range from 1 to 5.

{{ :app:authoring:authoring14.png?direct&700 |}}

And the completed number prompt:

{{ :app:authoring:authoring15.png?direct&700 |}}

Let's create one more prompt using the photo prompt type.  This one is quite simple, as you can leave the "max resolution" set to it's default.  Note though, if some of your responders wont be using a smartphone, you should make this prompt 'skippable' as they may not be able to take a picture!

{{ :app:authoring:authoring19.png?direct&700 |}}

After you've defined all of your prompts (or at any time while creating your prompts), you can click the "View Campaign XML" button on the left to take a look at the current XML representation of your campaign.  

{{ :app:authoring:authoring21.png?direct&700 |}}

You are also able to click "Create New Survey" to add multiple surveys to your campaign and "Edit Existing Surveys" to look at your campaign from a survey level.  The screenshot below shows this view:

{{ :app:authoring:authoring22.png?direct&700 |}}

When you're done, you can click "Submit Campaign to Server." Please note that after you've done this, any edits you do to your campaign will need to be done in XML, so only submit when you're sure the campaign is finished!

{{ :app:authoring:authoring23.png?direct&700 |}}

The final page will say congratulations, and you can either make a new campaign, or log out.
