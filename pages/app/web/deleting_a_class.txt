=====Deleting a Class Process=====

When you create a class, the system automatically creates three campaigns (FoodHabits, TimeUse, Stress and Chill) and two surveys (PersonalityColor, TimePerception) for that class.

In order for you to delete a class you must delete the campaigns and surveys corresponding to that class. 

*** Warning - Deleting a campaign will also delete any data that was collected by students for that campaign.**

 


====Step 1: Deleting Campaigns====

Go to the Campaign Manager on the [[https://ids.mobilizingcs.org/#|IDS home page]].

  * Click on Settings
