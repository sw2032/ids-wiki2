===== Browser-Based Surveys =====

The basic features of the UCLA MobilizingCS app are also available from the web, so you can take a survey without a mobile device.  To take surveys you can click on the [[https://ids.mobilizingcs.org/#survey|Survey Taking]] Tool on the IDS Homepage or by clicking the "Surveys" dropdown arrow on the IDS Mobilize Toolbar.
