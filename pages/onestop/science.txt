===== Science - Mobilize ONE-STOP =====

This wiki provides a single page with a step-by-step process (and all necessary links) required to participate in the Mobilize unit. The relevant curriculum can be found at [[https://ucla.box.com/v/mobilize|Mobilize Curriculum Directory]]. Please note, updated and final curriculum will be posted 4/11/2016. All URLs related to the Mobilize tools and applications are listed on [[https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/urls]].

**Want to support Mobilize Goals before the units implementation?**
  - Incorporate the data cycle into current units.
  - Utilize strategies to help students make sense of graphics, data tables, and visualizations. We used the OPTIC strategy from the AP College Board and ICEE in the unit. 
  - Structure activities to allow for student-to-student accountable talk. Talk Moves created by Sara Michaels is an excellent place to start.
  - Provide students with multiple opportunities to engage in the Science and Engineering Practices that are woven into content development, such as argumentation and modeling. Check out [[http://ambitiousscienceteaching.org|Ambitous Science Teaching Site]] 


==== Step 1 (Weeks+ before starting unit) - Handling Student/Parent Consent Forms ====
 
  * Please give students the Mobilize Consent Form Packet (student consent form - Blue, parent consent form - Yellow or Green) to complete. 
  * The consent forms are needed to help us gather data to measure and improve the effectiveness of the Mobilize units.  We need to have copies of __both__ the student and parent consent form from a particular student to include him/her in our study.
   * Upon returning the consent forms, please provide the CRESST team with a copy of your roster so that they can track which students did/did not sign consents.  

 * Student, and Teacher Consent forms for the 2015-16 academic year can be found in the "Consent Forms" folder here: [[https://ucla.box.com/v/mobilize|Mobilize Curriculum Directory]]

  * Complete Lesson 0: Where does my trash go? This lesson allows students to design a model of a sanitary landfill. Ideally, this model is created a minimum of two weeks before the first lesson. Students will also beging collecting data before the unit on their smart phones. This does not have to happen the day after Lesson 0. The goal is to increase the data collection window so that there are large sets for classes to explore.  

  * Review the Unit Level Graphic Organizer and the Unit at a Glance (beginning of the unit) to help you plan out when to reserve the computer lab. {{:onestop:ulgo_2015.xlsx|}}



==== Step 2 (Week+ before starting unit) - Check software; Create classes and accounts ==== 
  * {{:wiki:computer-3.png?nolink&20}} Make sure that you and your students will have access to a computer lab that satisfies the [[https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/requirements|minimum software requirements]]. This will be essential for Lesson 6.
  * To prevent a blank screen issue due to the LAUSD firewall, please follow [[http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/lausd/help_files/cert_filter.htm| the LAUSD instructions for installing their root certificate]] on your browser and on your students' browsers. 
  * {{:wiki:mobilize_finallogo_cmyk.png?nolink&60|}} Create your own class(es) and student accounts by following [[https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/app/web/teacher|the Mobilize Class Setup Process]].


==== Step 3 (Day 0) - Students Take the "Pre-Q" ====
  * {{:wiki:document-edit.png?nolink&20|}} Administer the student pre-questionnaire (or "Pre-Q") BEFORE beginning lesson 1. You will receive implementation packets with questionnaires at the April PD session.
  * The Pre-Q includes a series of data-related tasks and should take approximately 45 minutes or roughly one class period including directions, passing out Pre-Q's, etc.) to complete.   
    * You will also receive a link via email for a short pre-implementation survey. 
  * Contact Debbie La Torre Matrundola at 310.206.1385 or help@mobilizingcs.org  if you have any questions or concerns. 

==== Steps 4 through 10, Implement Science Lessons 1 through 9 (3 weeks) ====
[[https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/curriculum#mobilize_science_unit_supplemental_materials]]

  * Did something amazing or troubling happen and you would like to share it with the team? 
    *  Well, you can scan or photograph student work and upload it to our server by following the directions found in Step 12. 
    * You can email us to celebrate: [[help@mobilizingcs.org]].
    * Or visit us at our [[https://plus.google.com/communities/115661803352155510684|Google Group]] and post your news there. 


  * Lesson 9 is the end of unit assessment. Please make sure to remember to save students' assessments and upload following the protocol outlined in Step 12. 

   
==== Step 11 - At the End of Unit, Students Take the "Post-Q" ====
  * {{:wiki:document-edit.png?nolink&20|}} At the end of the unit, administer the student post-questionnaire (or "Post-Q"). Please see administration instructions in your implementation packet.
  * Instructions for returning materials are also provided in your implementation packet.
  * You will receive a link via email for a short post-implementation survey. 

==== Step 12 (Post Lessons) - Upload students' FINAL projects ====
  * First, please collect student work and the final projects from the unit. We will use the final projects to guide future revisions of the unit. Digital projects such as videos, PowerPoints, photographs or MP4s can be saved and uploaded to our server. 

  * Next, save noteworthy work **AND** FINAL projects.  Please label all projects using the following naming convention:

    * Your file names should look like: Science_L#_TeacherLastName_P#_G#_Task  
    * This expands to:" Science_Lesson#_Teacher's Last Name_Period #_Group # [if applicable]_Task [brief description of task]
      * Example: Science_L6_Perez_P3_G2_statisticalquestions (note that you do not include # in the file name)



  *Then, Log in to the Mobilize document tool at [[https://lausd.mobilizingcs.org/landing/#document/]] to upload students projects:
    * Click "Add New"
    * Click "Choose File" and select the file from your local system
      * If you'd like to test the functionality, {{:onestop:blue_parent_info_sheet_approved_09.05.13.pdf|here's a sample file to use}}
    * Update the name field to match the file name above (ensuring that you leave the file extension, eg. '.docx', '.pdf' as it is)
    * Leave the privacy state as "Private"
    * On "Share to Class" select the class this project relates to
    * Click "save" to finish upload.
