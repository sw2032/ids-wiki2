==== Step 1 (Week+ before starting unit) - Check software; Create classes and accounts ==== 
  * {{:wiki:computer-3.png?nolink&20}} Teachers make sure that they and their students will have access a computer lab that satisfies the [[https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/requirements|minimum software requirements]]. 
  * To prevent a blank screen issue due to a firewall, please ask your IT support for instructions for installing a root certificate on your and your students' browsers. 
  * Each IDS teacher creates their own classes and student accounts by following [[https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/app/web/teacher|the IDS Class Setup Process]].  


==== Step 3 (Day 0) - Students Take the "Pre-Q" ====
  * {{:wiki:document-edit.png?nolink&20|}} Teachers administer the student pre-questionnaire (or "Pre-Q") BEFORE beginning the unit. You will receive a packet of pre-questionnaires and administration directions at the August 29th training.
  * The Pre-Q includes a series of algebra and data-related tasks and should take approximately 45 minutes (1 class period including directions, passing out Pre-Q's, etc.) to complete.   
  * Teachers will also be asked to complete a short pre-survey before starting the unit.  You will receive a link via email. 
  * Contact Debbie La Torre Matrundola at 310.206.1385 or help@mobilizingcs.org  if you have any questions or concerns. 

// ** __Target Story__** //
When your students have completed the "Pre-Q" you will have time to present the Target Story; a brief video discussing data collection practices by large corporations. (Time: 4.5 minutes) When the video ends, ask students, "How did Target know she was pregnant?" Discuss first as teams and have each team share out.
